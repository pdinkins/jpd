    <h1>What are Non-Fungible Tokens?</h1>
    <h2>
        <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721" target="_blank">EIP-721: ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard</a>
    </h2>
    <div class="article">
    <p>Non-fungible tokens allow developers to encrypt ownership of arbitrary data, dramatically increasing the amount of data that 
        can be represented as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Non-fungible tokens allow developers to "tokenize" ownership of 
        arbitrary data and dramatically increase the number of tokens available to developers and users alike. [Sources: 0]*</p>
    <p>
        In the ERC721 token standard, each token in a contract contains different values and each is bound to a different identifier, 
making the token unique to its owner. The number of tokens that developers can create on the Ethereum blockchain using the 
non-fungible token standard is increasing dramatically. Unlike the tokens in the standard's "fungible" tokens, the "RC20" 
tokens are tokens that take advantage of the fact that they are interchangeable, meaning that there is no - to - ownership 
of a token, but rather a series of different identifiers that are interconnected to make it unique to each of its 
owners. [Sources: 0]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the ERC 20 token standard, where each token is a currency unit, the "RC721" tokens are different. Contracts that 
introduce the tokens into the standard can track all so-called "ERC 721 tokens" simultaneously. The non-fungible tokens, 
or "deals," are the most common type of token on the ethereum blockchain and one of the largest in terms of the 
number of tokens. [Sources: 3]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        The ERC 721 is the first standard to allow the creation of non-fungible tokens, and it opens titles and deeds to the 
types of tokens we have not seen before. [Sources: 3, 6]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because ERC 721 tokens are interchangeable and fungible, they have become massively popular as a means of representing 
ownership of a unique asset. [Sources: 6]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        If the ownership of an ERC721 means that the holder holds the rights to the token and what it represents, then that 
token is called a deed. Since it is assumed that documents are too closely linked to property and that nft could be 
used for so much more, the authors of E RC7 21 decided not to use their tokens as documents, as they can be 
represented by any number of different tokens, not only by a single token, but also by several tokens. [Sources: 4, 6]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        NFTs are unique and distinctive tokens that are mainly found on the EVM blockchain, but there are other N FTs on 
ERC1155, only one of which is an NFT. As with E RC20 tokens, there may be a number of different types of 
tokens (e.g. tokens with different properties), but only a few of them are EEC721, and they are all non-working 
tokens. [Sources: 4, 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        ERC721 is a set of rules that allows you to interact with other people's apps and contracts, but not with the 
blockchain of Ethereum itself. [Sources: 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        ERC721 is a free and open standard that describes how to build non-fungible and unique tokens on an 
EVM-compatible blockchain. ERC 721 tokens are unique in that there are no units, and most of them 
are "fungible" (indistinguishable), think rare, one - of - a - species, collectable, etc. [Sources: 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from being unique, ERC 721 tokens are commonly referred to as non-fungible, and therefore they 
are non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They are a kind of token without units, without fungibility, but a unique 
and unique token in the same class as other tokens. [Sources: 2, 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        The ERC 721 standard is an attempt to symbolize and create unique assets that can be transferred from one 
wallet to another. However, this can be slow and inefficient when multiple pieces of armor are transferred 
to a game for a particular character. This is where E RC 1155 comes in, as it can offer a unique digital 
NFT that allows you to transfer multiple pieces of armor in the same game without the need for 
multiple wallets. [Sources: 2]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an improved version of the ERC 1155 standard proposed by the Enjin team, also known as the crypto-item 
standard. It will indeed be a platform on which tens of thousands of digital items and goods will be stored. 
The strength of an NFT is that each token is unique and cannot be confused with each other. There is no need to 
make Bitcoins interchangeable with one-to-one currencies. Is the E RC 721 really a token that is not only unique 
but also incompatible with other tokens? [Sources: 1, 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        As cryptocurrencies become synonymous with blockchains, the same technology can be used to store all kinds of 
digital objects. This opens the door to the digitisation of many different assets and marks a step in this 
direction. The current problem with ERC 721 is that if you want to symbolise 100,000 items, you have to use 
100,000 separate smart contracts. [Sources: 5, 7]* 
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider how non-fungible tokens differ from traditional tokens and how they are likely to be treated for 
        tax purposes. An NFT (Non-Fungibility Token) is a special cryptographic token that uses blockchain technology 
        to link a unique digital asset that cannot be replicated. These are cryptographic tokens that represent something 
        unique, such as a physical object or work of art. [Sources: 5, 8]*

        <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155" target="_blank">EIP-1155: ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard</a>
    </h2>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            This is a standard for instantiating multiple tokens in a single smart contract, 
and it means that creating new token types can be as simple as calling a function 
that adds a new ID to the pool of available tokens. In comparison, creating a newer 
token type in accordance with ERC standard 20-721 means changing the code and assigning 
a completely new contract to an address in the Ethereum blockchain. [Sources: 3]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Smart contracts can be used in many ways, but one of the most popular features is 
that anyone can create a unique token, an ERC token, that exists and works on the 
Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum also has a currency that is used to buy resources from 
the chain that it can use, and it is called ether (ETH). This currency can operate the 
platform without transaction fees as is known from the gas (gwei) sector, but the 
provision of a contract can cause enormous costs for gas and ETH, as data storage on 
a blockchain shared by the world is, of course, expensive. [Sources: 2, 3]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            The ERC is an acronym that stands for "Ethereum Request for Comment," indicating that 
the Etehreum chain can be understood as the standard at application level. [Sources: 2]* 
        </p>
        <p>This allows a single contract to contain a number of different types of tokens such 
            as ether, ethereum, litecoin and ether. It can contain the Etehreum token, the 
            Ethereum blockchain, as well as other Ethereum tokens and other tokens. [Sources: 2, 4]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard interface allows to distinguish between the individual elements within 
the scope of a contract. In particular, the design of this interface offers the 
possibility to transfer several token types at once, e.g. game items. The token ID 
represents a new configurable token type that can have its own unique identifier, 
such as the Etehreum token or the Ethereum blockchain. [Sources: 4]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            ERC 1155 can be used as a commercial coin that functions as currency on various 
platforms such as Etehreum, ETC, Ethereum or the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-1155 
and can use assets and items that represent Enjin's ecosystem of blockchains, 
games, etc. [Sources: 6]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another advantage of the ERC-1155 is that it allows the creation of smart contracts 
with more than one token in a single smart agreement, as opposed to E RC-20, where 
new contracts must be introduced for each token. There is no need for a multi-token 
standard to initiate more than one token in individual, smart agreements. It is 
suitable for projects where one of these tokens is referred to as a security or 
supply token or a smart contract, for example. [Sources: 0, 6]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            This way, developing a new token type can be as simple as calling a function that 
adds a brand - a new ID to the pool of available tokens. [Sources: 0]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Because storing information on a blockchain shared with the world is, of course, 
            costly, providing agreements can cost large amounts of gasoline (ETH) to use. 
            Since operations must be recorded on the Ethereum network of more than 25,000 
            nodes, the ability to issue many tokens at once can minimize the amount of code 
            required to emboss tokens, thereby reducing the total cost of gas. For comparison, 
            we have created a way to edit the code and apply it to a large number of Ethereum 
            nodes in a relatively short time. [Sources: 0, 5]*  
        </p>
        <p>
            The multi-token standard is also backwards compatible with ERC 721, so developers 
can add adapters that make the E RC 1155 token look like an Erc 20 token. The standard 
has been tested to ensure that it is not only compatible with the Ethereum protocol, 
but also with other Ethereum protocols such as Ethereum Classic, and developers who want 
to adopt it can do so without worrying about switching to another standard in the future. 
Positive news also came when Enjin launched its blockchain SDK for Unity on the Ethereum 
test network. [Sources: 5]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            The ERC 1155 token standard allows developers to use a single smart contract and then 
emboss new tokens in seconds. By embossing - that - you can continue to use one of your 
Smart Contracts forever, with an infinite number of tokens available for embossing. [Sources: 1]*
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many Dapps rely on traditional databases, 
explorers, and API services to retrieve and categorize data. For example, Enjin has 
created a blockchain development platform that revolves around a single smart contract. 
The event logs broadcast by Smart Contracts will allow you to create accurate records 
of your current token balance. [Sources: 1, 3]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            A database explorer can listen to events and provide indexing, categorization of searches 
and other data - rich features. [Sources: 3]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be done by a limited release through an additional interface to an external 
contract. A single contract can include a database explorer, an indexer, a search engine, 
and other data - extensive features and a data store. [Sources: 7, 8]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also easy to describe and mix several tokens (e.g. coins, tokens and other tokens) 
in a contract. Trading with multiple tokens can be based on the standard and exempt from 
the need to approve individual token contracts separately. In addition to saving on 
transaction costs, you can also transfer multiple types of tokens at the same time 
without paying any additional fees. [Sources: 7]*
