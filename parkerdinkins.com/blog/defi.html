    <h1>What is DeFi?</h1>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            Decentralised financial systems are a series of financial applications built on a decentralised register, 
better known as blockchain. The way blockchains are structured and used has many implications for the 
financial industry. To take the definition of DeFi a little further, decentralized finance considers a 
system designed to function without a central authority. [Sources: 4]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is a new approach that uses a public, distributed register that supports 
autonomy and creates a peer-to-peer financial network. The new system does this without relying on a 
central authority and its users interact via decentralised applications (Dapps) running on peer-to-peer 
(P2P) networks. [Sources: 4, 6]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Decentralized finance, or simply DeFi, refers to financial applications built on a blockchain network. 
More specifically, the term decentralized finance could refer to a movement aimed at creating a 
decentralized financial system that is open to all and operates without central authority. The de-fi 
ecosystem consists of decentralised applications (Dapps) that function as authorization-free services, 
meaning that users do not rely on intermediaries to process their requests. [Sources: 5, 6]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Users interact with the ecosystem through decentralized applications and would retain full control of 
their assets. In addition, users interact directly with each other and with other users of the decentralised 
application, such as traders and investors. [Sources: 5]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, the financial revolution is trying to create an ecosystem of financial services that is accessible 
to everyone and allows everyone to take full control of their financial assets. Blockchain technology, in 
particular, has enabled this kind of decentralized financial ecosystem to be introduced in the first place. 
Because DeFi wants to get rid of the central financial authority, it means that anyone can access a wide range 
of assets, including stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. [Sources: 7]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since DeFi does not require intermediate parties, all would interact decentrally in the ecosystem. 
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were created to make it easier for people to exchange values with others 
around the world. This desire has arisen from a new movement within the cryptoindustry known as decentralized 
finance, or "DeFi." [Sources: 4, 7]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            The DeFi movement takes cryptocurrencies a step further, but it is still building on the underlying technology 
that drives them, and it is going a step further with a few adjustments. Decentralized finance, or "DeFi," is the 
latest innovation emerging from blockchain - the decentralized energy economy. De Fi is about applications that 
build on a blockchain, a decentralized ledger that tracks all transactions on its blockchain publicly. [Sources: 0, 4]*
        </p>
        <p>
            This decentralised, borderless way of doing things allows anyone with an Internet connection to have access 
to financial products and services. DeFi applications, which are mainly based on the Ethereum network, offer 
users traditional financial services. Today, a de-Fi user can borrow, lend, invest, make payments, and make 
purchases and loans in a decentralized manner without financial institutions or intermediaries, which he can 
do today without a financial institution or intermediary. [Sources: 0]*

        <p>
            In a decentralized financial system, transactions are immutable, blockchain cannot be shut down, and users 
can part ways to protect their assets. In Venezuela, Venezuelans have introduced bitcoin to protect their 
wealth from government manipulation and hyperinflation. [Sources: 8]*

            Today's infographic is from the Abra investment app, a plug-and-play app that allows people to intuitively 
use decentralized financial services without the complexity of centralized systems. How could public blockchain 
help decentralized financial systems? [Sources: 3, 8]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Decentralized finance describes new decentralized financial systems based on public blockchains such as 
Bitcoin or Ethereum. After all, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not the only blockchain systems that could be used 
to change the way the global economy works. The initialization of blockchain use cases with Bitcoin has shown 
that value moves faster and more efficiently than any other financial system in the world. [Sources: 1, 8]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Ethereum makes digital money highly programmable and enables distributed users to execute code in the form of 
smart contracts. Beyond speculation and value storage, Ethereum allows many aspects of traditional finance to 
run on an open network with a ramp - upwards, allowing the creation of new types of assets such as stocks, bonds, 
and other financial instruments. [Sources: 1]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Just four years after the launch of Ethereum, transactions worth more than $1 trillion were processed through 
Ethereum, and more than $13 billion was completed through smart contracts from Ethereum. With over 13 million 
users on the Ethereum network, decentralized finance has become the most active sector in the blockchain space, 
with $14 billion of its value going to Ethereum's smart contract. Just four years after its launch, just over 
half of the world's top 100 financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, 
Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo, are part of this experiment. [Sources: 1, 2]* 
        </p>
        <p>
            Decentralised financial systems take over traditional financial systems that run on a central infrastructure 
managed by central authorities, institutions and intermediaries. By providing invariable smart contracts on 
Ethereum, DeFi developers have created a financial protocol platform that runs exactly as programmed and is 
available to anyone with an Internet connection. The code runs on a decentralized infrastructure, the Ethereum 
blockchain, without central authority or intermediaries responsible for its operation. [Sources: 2]*
